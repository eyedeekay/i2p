# Mac OSX Installation Screenshots

![OSX Installation Screenshots](macosx.png)
Here are some screenshots that should help you install the I2P .dmg package.

The .dmg package behaves just like Mac applications normally do, where they
"Slide" into place in the application directory.

## **Step One:** License Agreement

First, like with most software, you'll be presented with a License
agreement. This simply states that our software is Free and Open Source,
and that you may Use, Study, Modify, and Share it.

Now that all the I2P software can be bundled into a single package for
Mac users, it's possible to share the .dmg as a way of spreading I2P.

## **Step Two:** Install the Applications

Next, you'll need slide the I2P "Dock Icon" into your "Applications
Directory." This will begin installing the I2P application image.

## **Step Three:** Do you already have a router?

If you already have an I2P router installed using the .jar file created by
IzPack, you will see two I2P routers in your Applications Directory.

This is usable, but you should only run one router at a time. They will
both use the same Application Directory.

## **Step Four:** Complete Installation

When you do this, Mac OSX will present you with information about the person
who notarized the installer, and prove the I2P router was not tampered with.

You'll be able to tell I2P is running when an I2P Icon appears in your Dock.
