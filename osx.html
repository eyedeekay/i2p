<h1>Mac OSX Installation Screenshots</h1>

Here are some screenshots that should help you install the I2P .dmg package.</p>

<p>The .dmg package behaves just like Mac applications normally do, where they
"Slide" into place in the application directory.</p>

<h2><strong>Step One:</strong> License Agreement</h2>

<p>First, like with most software, you'll be presented with a License
agreement. This simply states that our software is Free and Open Source,
and that you may Use, Study, Modify, and Share it.</p>

<p>Now that all the I2P software can be bundled into a single package for
Mac users, it's possible to share the .dmg as a way of spreading I2P.</p>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Step Two:</strong> Install the Applications</h2>

<p>Next, you'll need slide the I2P "Dock Icon" into your "Applications
Directory." This will begin installing the I2P application image.</p>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Step Three:</strong> Do you already have a router?</h2>

<p>If you already have an I2P router installed using the .jar file created by
IzPack, you will see two I2P routers in your Applications Directory.</p>

<p>This is usable, but you should only run one router at a time. They will
both use the same Application Directory.</p>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Step Four:</strong> Complete Installation</h2>

<p>When you do this, Mac OSX will present you with information about the person
who notarized the installer, and prove the I2P router was not tampered with.</p>

<p>You'll be able to tell I2P is running when an I2P Icon appears in your Dock.</p>
